# Wine-Quality
In this project, we worked with the Wine Quality dataset, which includes chemical properties of red and white wines, to build a machine learning model that classifies wine quality into three categories: low, medium, and high. We began by merging the red and white wine datasets, adding a new feature to distinguish between the two types. The original quality score (0–10) was converted into a 3-class label to simplify the problem into a multi-class classification task. We then applied extensive feature engineering to create 21 features by combining and transforming existing attributes such as acidity, sugar, alcohol, and sulfur levels, enhancing the model’s ability to detect complex patterns. After preprocessing (including scaling and train-test splitting), we trained and evaluated eight machine learning models individually: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost. Each model's performance was assessed using accuracy, F1-score, and a confusion matrix to visualize prediction strengths and weaknesses across classes. This approach allowed a comprehensive comparison of models to identify the most effective classifier for predicting wine quality.
